# Ping-Pong-Game
This repo contains code for a 4-player, peer to peer networking based Ping Pong game, designed and implemented using Swing library for graphics and TCP/IP socket programming in Java for networking. To maintain seamless continuity of the game during network outages, a player losing connection is replaced by an Artificial Intelligence bot.
